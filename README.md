# X-Music (CrossMusic App)

## Features
This app allows you to do the search for a track/album/artist across different streaming platforms. Just paste the link to one streaming into the text field and press "Search". You'll be given a result containing links to Spotify, Apple Music and Youtube. (More streamings to come!)

## Privacy
We don't track your links, nor we track the results. No data that can be attributed to you is collected by us. 
What we track - when you open the app, and when you use the search in a way to have the info whether the search has succeeded or failed. The details of the search are unknown to us.
The links that you paste are analysed on device. They never leave it.
To search across different streamings we use Spotify/Apple/Google API.
